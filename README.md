# CTA Retake Information

This doc contains more detailed info on the CTA retake and how your work will be evaluated.

## Schedule

- You will have at least 3 hours to work on this assessment independently
    - During your independent work, instructors can help you with problems with npm install, or problems running the server and front end that seem related to issues with the starter code
    - Instructors can't help with debugging code that you've written
- Later the same day, you'll have a 1:1 meeting with an instructor for up to one hour to talk about your work and pair program

## How you'll be graded

During your 1:1 meeting, an instructor will look for the following:

| Result |                 Description                  |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------ |
|  Pass  | You already finished all of the requirements listed in the backend and frontend requirements sections. |
|  Pass  | Some of your requirements were not finished before the meeting, but you finished them during the meeting by pair programming with your instructor. |
|  Pass  |  You weren’t able to finish all of the requirements during the meeting, but you could clearly explain what you would do next to finish them. |
|  Pass  | You showed your ability to do the different portions of the test individually:<ol><li>Render list of GIVEN resources.</li><li>Create a controller route that finishes a response with a GIVEN list of resources. This includes server.js, app.js, and a controller file</li><li>Create a database with a table of resources.</li><li>Query a database using JavaScript</li></ol>|
|  Not Pass  | You didn't meet any of the criteria above. |

## Preparing for your 1:1 with an Instructor

- Make sure all of your code is pushed to your GitHub PR
- Have your project running locally and be ready to screen share the site on your browser as well as the code in VS Code.
- Be ready to describe how your code works. This means talking about what happens from page load to back end to front end render. At each step of the process, be ready to show the code you wrote that makes it happen.
- If you didn’t finish the project, be ready to say what you would do next to finish it.
- If your project has a bug, be ready to say what the bug is if you know already, or steps you would take to find the bug.
- If there are parts of the requirements where you’re not sure what to do, be ready to talk about how you would research or learn how to do those things.
